### Hello Adventurers,

We've been hard at work creating enemies and characters to make the game feel truly immersive. In this post, we'll give you a glimpse of our progress in enemy creation and character creation, as well as our time commitment per week and our demo scope. But first of all some answers about the game concept that have been asked under our last blogpost:
- The game will be a isometric 3d isometric action game
- The name of the game has no relation to any real world country. Credits for the name have to be given to ChatGPT ðŸ˜‰!

### Enemy Creation

Creating enemies has been an exciting and challenging process. We want to ensure that each enemy has a unique set of abilities and behaviors that will make the game challenging and enjoyable. Currently, we have created several types of enemies such as skeletons, spiders and golems. Further enemies are in the works, and we're excited to share them with you in the future.

### Character Creation

We understand the importance of customization in games, and we want our players to feel unique. That's why we've put a lot of effort into character creation. With the current state the player is able to cast different spells both offensive and defensive such as fireball, lightning bolt and healing. We're also working on melee attacks such as sword strikes and staff hits. Further spells and a whole skill tree are in the works.

### Time Commitment

We' ve decided to dedicate an average of 7-8 hours per person per week over the semester to work on the game. This time includes brainstorming, programming, and playtesting. We believe that this time commitment will help us stay on track with our development schedule while ensuring that we produce a high-quality game.

### Demo Scope
The Demo on the 24th of March will include a working player-enemy combat system in a sample level. The player will be able to fight against multiple enemies and use spells to defeat them. We'll also implement a system for spawning enemies, ensuring that the game stays challenging. Additionally, the camera movement, will be completed by this day. The spells will have cooldown timers to make the game more strategic, and we'll create a simple UI that displays e.g. the player's health.
