Hello Adventurers,

welcome to our first blog post about the development of Aetherea. This week, we'll present to you our game concept.
We started with a touching story and worked our way through a combat system, the enemies and the automatic level generation. For starters, you can read the introduction of the storyline here:

*In the magical world of Aetherea, there lived a young magician named Alara. He was a talented and ambitious mage who had been studying the art of magic for as long as he could remember. Alara had always dreamed of finding a powerful artifact that was said to grant the user immense magical abilities. He knew that many other mages and adventurers were also searching for this artifact, but he was determined to find it first.*

Combat in Aetherea is a mix of melee attacks and magical spells, and players will need to carefully choose which to use depending on the situation.
There are several types of magic spells in Aetherea, each with its own unique properties. For example, fireball is a powerful offensive spell that deals a large amount of damage to enemies in a small area. Lightning bolt, on the other hand, is a fast, focused spell that can deal a significant amount of damage to a single target. Defensive spells like shield can help you avoid damage and move through levels unnoticed.
In addition to spells, players can also use melee attacks like sword strikes and staff hits to deal damage to enemies. These attacks are great for close-range combat and can be used in combination with spells to create devastating combos.

Following up next we thought about the enemies. You'll encounter a wide range of magical creatures that will put your skills to the test. Each enemy has its own unique strengths and weaknesses, so you'll need to adapt your strategy accordingly. For example there are small units that come always in groups or distance fighters with less HP. And let's not forget about the bosses! Aetherea features several challenging boss battles, each with their own unique mechanics and weaknesses. You'll need to study each boss carefully to find their weakness, and use all of your skills and abilities to defeat them.
Aetherea features also automatic level generation, meaning that no two playthroughs will be the same. Each dungeon is randomly generated, providing a unique and exciting challenge every time you play.

Please leave us some feedback in the comment, see you in short time again.
