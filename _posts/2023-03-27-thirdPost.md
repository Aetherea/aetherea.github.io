### Hello Adventurers,

the presentation of our demo was a real success. Today, we want to share with you information about how you can access our project as a music student, what you can expect, when working for our project and how much time we spent so far.

### Teaser of our project

Here is a small video, where you can see how our game looks so far.

Coming up next is some UI for the player, so that you can properly start and also pause the game. Also the player's abilities will be enhanced by melee combat.

### For the music students

If you have decided to contribute to our project with your music, pls contact us on discord. For the music itself, we think of some background music that supports the atmosphere. This will include different songs for different enemies, e.g. something epic in a boss fight or something chill, when no enemy is around. So far, we will have skeletons, spiders and a golem and dragon as bosses, but the list of enemies keeps growing.

#### How to add your music to our game?
We try to achieve an easy way to add the music to the game, which means ideally you would just have to drag specific songs onto the Scriptable Objects we made with unity.
The whole project is up on [gitHub](https://github.com/Aetherea/Aetherea-Game), stored with Git LFS (Large File Storage). To get access to the project and especially the scriptable objects, you will need the following:
- Unity Hub and Unity Editor (Version 2021.3.21f1)
- Git LFS (Download [here](https://git-lfs.com/))
- Further steps are to clone the repository as usual and execute "git-lfs pull" in order to get the original files.

### Time Spent by now

Since we estimated the time we will spend each week, here is a short summary of how we did so far:
- Tim: 23.25 hours over three weeks, which results in 7.75 hours / week
- Fabian: 26.45 hours over three weeks, which results in 8.82 hours / week

As a conclusion, the goal of 7-8 hours per week is reached by both of us and we made great progress. The tool we are using to track our time is git projects, where we open issues for everything we do and track our time on those tasks.

Thats it for this weeks blog, I hope you enjoyed the summary of our game and the little teaser. Hopefully we will have some music too very soon.
